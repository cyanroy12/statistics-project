Statistical Analysis of House Prices
This project involves an in-depth statistical analysis of housing prices using a dataset containing various features that influence property values. The primary objective is to uncover relationships between these features and the median house price.

Key Highlights:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical summaries of key features such as crime rates, average rooms per dwelling, property tax rates, and proximity to the Charles River.
Feature Correlation: Analysis of how factors like nitric oxide concentration, accessibility to highways, and pupil-teacher ratios impact housing prices.
Modeling and Insights: Simple linear regression and other statistical models to identify the most significant predictors of housing prices.
Real-World Implications: Insights derived can help urban planners, real estate developers, and policymakers make data-driven decisions.
Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
This repository provides a step-by-step approach for conducting statistical analyses, making it a valuable reference for data enthusiasts and professionals in real estate, urban planning, and related fields.
